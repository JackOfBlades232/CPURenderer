Obj reader (not from beginning):
- Impl file read state (for storing vertices, materials, etc.)
- Impl mtl file parsing with mat_buf and mapping fill
- Impl usemtl (setting cur mat) and applying to objects
- Impl v/vt/vn parsing with storing in buf
- Impl f parsing (face creation with v and indices from buf, triangle split)
- Add data from vt/vn to objects and rendering
- Optimize parsing structures and allocations

Add debug modes:

Add reflection and refraction:

Misc:
- Add C^2 to post-proc
- When processing an intersection offset the pos by eps from surface
    ( and remove checking for same object coll )

Further improvements:
- Improve speed with algo from SHAD tasks
- Impl auto testing for png results (pix comp)
