Obj reader (not from beginning):
* Impl file read state (for storing vertices, materials, etc.)
* Impl mtl file parsing with mat_buf and mapping fill
* Impl usemtl (setting cur mat) and applying to objects
* Impl v/vt/vn parsing with storing in buf
- Impl f parsing
    * Impl get_index with neg indices
    - Impl parsing of f item (number, /, //)
    - Impl triangle slicing
- Add data from vt/vn to objects and rendering

- Optimize parsing structures and allocations
- Check for mem leaks

Add debug modes:

Add reflection and refraction:

Misc:
- Add C^2 to post-proc
- When processing an intersection offset the pos by eps from surface
    ( and remove checking for same object coll )

Further improvements:
- Improve speed with algo from SHAD tasks
- Impl auto testing for png results (pix comp)
