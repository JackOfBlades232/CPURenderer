Obj reader (not from beginning):
* Impl file read state (for storing vertices, materials, etc.)
* Impl mtl file parsing with mat_buf and mapping fill
* Impl usemtl (setting cur mat) and applying to objects
* Impl v/vt/vn parsing with storing in buf
* Impl f parsing
    * Impl get_index with neg indices
    * Impl parsing of f item (number, /, //)
    * Impl triangle slicing

Add debug modes:
* Normal: color = 1/2normal + 1/2, where normal turned away from camera
* Depth: color = depth/max depth (black-white)

Make classic box work:
* Remake camera init to look-at
* Debug and fix classic-box

Add vertex normals and vertex texcoord to triangles (and obj parsing):

Add reflection and refraction:

Misc:
* Add C^2 to post-proc

Further improvements:
- Improve speed with algo from SHAD tasks
- Impl auto testing for png results (pix comp)
